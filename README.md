# Marketing Mix Modelling
#### How a yoghurt company can optimize its ROI through Data Science.
(May 2021)

### General Information
This university project was carried out in collaboration with a multinational marketing agency whose goal was to innovate the way they extracted insights from marketing data for a a yoghurt company selling in multinational retail chains. Our professors posed several questions to be answered with a marketing mix model based on contextual variables (e.g., competitors' marketing variables, economic situation, market behaviour) and on media ones (e.g., TV GRP, Social Media Impressions, ...) relating to one of the submarkets that the competes in (called "Submarket 1").
The data we were provided with referred to the timeframe Q3 2017 - Q2 2021. In particular, we had:
* Sales and main marketing variables time series for the companies competing in three submarkets (marketing variables: prices, promos, distribution, product assortment, ...).
* Focal company's investments and impressions data of different media, both digital and TV.

### About the files
There are two documents in this repository:
  1) Methodological Slides: this presentation contains a very detailed report of all the steps we followed to get to the results. First, there is a general description of the market and submarkets and the company media strategy. Then, the modelling tool and the path towards the model are highlighted; here, all our decisions are well-documented, as well as the tool which the model is based upon. Finally, the model outputs, the answers to the questions, and the practical recommendations are listed.
  2) CMO Slides: I created this set of slides to present to the CMO the results of our study, and the things the marketing department should do in order to optimize its budget based on the data they provided. This set of slides only looks at a part of the overall project (that is, the model results and industrialization steps), and it has been created for me to exercise to make consulting-style slides to present to the top-management of the company.

### Detail on the main results achieved
My group not only answered the questions, but also developed a realistic model ready for test and use, and provided statistically strong recommendations on how the customer can allocate its media budget; it is interesting to see how the model we developed highlighted several investment inefficiencies, and low flexibility and reaction time to market changes by the client company; based on that, it recommended ways of efficiently allocating the budget in order to optimize the media ROI. To make our contribution more complete, we did not limit ourselves to create the model, but also studied how some companies industrialized similar solutions including them in their day-to-day processes, and structured useful recommendations for our customer to do the same. To make the overall results more credible, we finally performed an economic feasibility analysis that showed how, even in the worst case scenario, introducing our marketing mix model could pay back investments in less than a year. 
The tool we used to answer these questions is Meta's R library "Robyn", which was selected among other different options because it conveyed the perfect balance between statistical soundness of results and orientation to business. 

The code is hereby not reported; the relevant plots are present in the methodological slides. However, I'll be pleased to share pieces of code if someone would like them!
